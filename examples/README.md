# Sprout Import Examples

## Importing Content

The example files for importing content in the `examples/content` folder are meant to be a reference for importing content using the supported Craft Import Format. Since each Craft installation is unique, the example files are provided as a reference. If you wish to use an example import file from the content folder, you will first need to update the details for your particular import needs.

For example, Section IDs and User IDs may be different for your Craft installation and you will need to update those values to use ids that match your specific content.

## Starter Patterns

The examples in the `examples/patterns` folder are Starter Patterns. Starter Patterns provide a useful way to build and reuse and share your favorite content architecture patterns and kick start website development. For example, you can build a starter pattern to create a Blog with a Longform Content Matrix Field. After you import your starter pattern you can generate fake data for that section using the Seed Generator. Within minutes you can be up and running and designing your front-end templates with a realistic representation of the content you will be working with.

Starter Patterns can probably be used on any Craft installation. They do not make assumptions about what content architecture exists. They create the content architecture for you when they are imported. 

## Generating Fake Data

The examples in the `examples/seed` folder are base templates that can generate 100s or 1000s of fake entries.

Place these examples in your `craft/templates` folder, adjust the output to generate fake data for your content requirements, and visit the front-end URL where they display to download a copy of the file to import.

## Sprout Plugin Examples

Sprout Import also provides examples for importing data into the Sprout Suite of plugins, including Sprout Forms, Sprout Email, Sprout SEO (useful for importing Redirects for migrated content that has changed URLs), and Sprout Fields.

Each example will require you install the related Sprout Plugin. Download a free trial of any commercial Sprout Plugin from https://sprout.barrelstrengthdesign.com/craft-plugins.
